            Messi was born the third of four children in a working-class family. His father, Jorge, was a factory steel
            worker, and his mother, Celia, worked as a part-time cleaner. From a young age, Messi showed a remarkable
            talent for football, playing in the streets with his friends and impressing coaches with his skills.
            However, Messi's early years were not without their struggles.At the age of six, he was diagnosed with a
            growth hormone
            deficiency that threatened to derail his footballing dreams.
        </div>
        <div class="box4-2">
            However, his time at the club was cut short
            when, at the age of 13, he was offered a chance to join FC Barcelona's prestigious youth academy, La Masia.
            Moving to Spain was a difficult decision for Messi and his family, but they knew it was a once-in-a-lifetime
            opportunity. Messi struggled to adapt to life in a new country and a new culture, and he often felt homesick
            and lonely. His small stature and medical condition also made it difficult for him to compete against
            bigger, stronger opponents.
        </div>
        <div class="box4-3">
            His family could not afford the expensive medical treatments required to help him grow, and they were forced
            to rely on a charity that agreed to pay for his
            treatments. Despite the financial burden on his family and the physical challenges he faced, Messi remained
            committed to his football career. He joined the youth academy of Newell's Old Boys, a local club in Rosario
            and quickly made a name for himself as a prodigious talent.
        </div>
        <div class="box4-4">
            Despite these challenges, Messi continued to work hard and improve his game.
            He made his first-team debut for Barcelona at the age of 17, and he quickly established himself as one of
            the most talented players in the world. He has since won numerous titles with Barcelona, including 10 La
            Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and four Champions League titles. He has also won the Ballon d'Or,
            the award for the world's best player, a record seven times.

    <h1 class="heading">IS HE THE GREATEST?</h1>
    <div class="box5">
        The simple and straight forward answer to that question is -Most Probably. The football world has had its
        good
        share of entertainment with the Messi-Ronaldo debate that has been going on all the way back since 2008!
        While
        the pair looked to be unseparable, in recent times specially after the 2022 World Cup, where Messi led his
        country to the Pinnacle of World football by becoming World Champions, more people now opt to choose him as
        the
        better one. There are other players who are very strong contenders for this title like Diego Maradona and
        Pele. But, when we combine the statistics, achievements, the impact and the performances on the field, Messi
        seems to be the player emerging victorious. While some people try to undermine him by labelling him just as
        a
        God-gifted talent, it would be an injustice not to give credit to his humility, mental strength,
        perseverance,
        hard work and leadership. Lionel Messi also is one of the very few players who has literally "won it all".
        He
        has built possibly the most illustrious career consisting of 700+ goals, 300+ assists, hundreds of MOTM
        awards,
        77 individual honors and nearly 40 Trophies!
